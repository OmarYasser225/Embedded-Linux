Using various APIs and libraries, it enables voice recognition, text-to-speech conversion, web browsing, application launching, and more. Users can interact with the assistant through voice commands to perform tasks such as searching the web, retrieving weather information, sending WhatsApp messages, fetching summaries from Wikipedia, and even enjoying a few jokes. This project leverages Python libraries such as SpeechRecognition, gTTS, pygame, pyautogui, pywhatkit, and Wikipedia to deliver a versatile and engaging voice assistant experience.
